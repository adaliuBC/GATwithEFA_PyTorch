## Graph Attention Network with Edge Feature Attention

This code reproduces the result of \[1\] in PyTorch, and the code derives from [https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT](https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT), which is a PyTorch implementation of \[2\]. The classification accuracy is 95.14%.

## Run

Run GAT\_EFA:

> sh ./script/GAT\_EFA.sh

You may also run other methods \(MLP, GCN, GAT\) with `.sh` files in path `./script`.
